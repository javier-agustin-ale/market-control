## Market Control

This project code is for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of several products. 

Each product has it owns price, which can be changed from the “Products Management” tab. In this section we can also add/edit the “Special Offers”, this means that when the user selects the required amount of the same product, a new price will be charge instead of the unit price. 

For Example, Apple unit price is $2; “Special Offer” is 2 for $3. So, when the user adds 2 apples to the shopping cart, the price to pay will be $3. 

Of course, it's possible to get more than one offer for the same product, so if the user adds 4 apples to the cart, he will get 2 offers, meaning that the total price to pay will be $6 (“Special Offer” x 2).
